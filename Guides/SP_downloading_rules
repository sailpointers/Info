You can export rules from your Identity Security Cloud tenant using either the SailPoint CLI or the SP-Config API.

***Option 1: Using the SailPoint CLI
**Step 1: Export Rules
Run the export command to initiate an export job:
sail spconfig export

To export specific object types including rules, you can create a template:
{  "name": "export-rules",  "description": "Export rules and related objects",  "variables": [],  "exportBody": {    "description": "Export rules",    "excludeTypes": [],    "includeTypes": [      "RULE",      "TRANSFORM",      "SOURCE",      "IDENTITY_PROFILE"    ],    "objectOptions": {}  }}

Then run the template:
sail spconfig template export-rules

**Step 2: Download the Export Results

After the export job completes, download the results using the job ID:
Linux/Mac:
sail spconfig download --export {export job ID}

Windows:
sail spconfig download --export {export job ID}

You can specify where to save the file:
sail spconfig download --export {export job ID} --folderPath /path/to/save


***Option 2: Using the SP-Config API
**Step 1: Initiate Export
Make a POST request to the export endpoint:
POST https://{tenant}.api.identitynow.com/v2024/sp-config/export

Request Body:
{  "description": "Export rules",  "excludeTypes": [],  "includeTypes": [    "RULE",    "TRANSFORM"  ],  "objectOptions": {}}

**Step 2: Check Export Status
Use the job ID returned from the export request to check the status.

**Step 3: Download Results
Once complete, download the JSON configuration file containing your rules.

•	RULE - Cloud-executed rules and connector rules
